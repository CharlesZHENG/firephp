- Refactor FirePHPRenderer API to introduce:
	 - ProcessRequest - to be called automatically after every request load (DONE)
	 - RenderRequest - to be called when "Server" tab is clicked
	 - SetRequestHTML - to be called by renderer to make the rendered HTML visible for the request
	 
- Initialize a new Renderer object for every unique renderer URL. When the requests
  are handled call the appropriate renderer. Allow different renderers to exist
  at the same time for different request URL's.


- Allow the ProcessRequest method to render debug data in dedicated FirePHP panel.
	=> Will log for firebug console for now.


- Test suite to allow testing of Renderers outside of Firebug (in main browser)
  and thus allow debugging of renderer code using firebug.

  Waitning for additional bug reports

- Bugfix for hostname check to correctly verify "localhost" and IP hostnames.
	=> This should work.
