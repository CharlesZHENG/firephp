-------------------------------
 Overall
-------------------------------

- Write tutorial on how to build your own log style

- Document the domplate system as it will be used extensively for custom renderers
  and processors.  

- Create page in wiki for drupal integration.
  http://drupal.org/search/node/firephp
  Supply patch for cleaner integration.
  
- Create page in wiki for CodeIgniter integration
  http://codeigniter.com/wiki/Fire_Ignition/
  Supply patch for cleaner integration.
  
- Add support for Zend_DB_Profiler to send data to FirePHP in Zend Framework Integration
  http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.profiler.html

-------------------------------
 Version 0.1.x
-------------------------------

- Add usleep(1) to header writing loop in FirePHPCore lib

- Ensure chunk_split does not generate trailing "\n" with empty data header in FirePHPCore lib

- FF2 - When Firefox is first started and a page is called that uses FirePHP, sometimes the
  request processor is called twice.

- FF3 - Catch iframes loading on first parent/main page load.

- FirePHP::LIST log style

- Automatic updates for FF3

- FB1.2 - Print INFO message instead of FirePHP messages in FB console when response came from cache
				- Print NOTE on server tab if data came from cache


-------------------------------
 Version 0.2.x
-------------------------------

- FB1.2 - Add FirePHP panel that is disabled by default and asks users to enable it for each website
          just like the Net panel does in FB1.2
				- More reliable detection for when Firebug is enabled/disabled to enable/disable FirePHP user-agent header
          

- Refactor FirePHPRenderer API to introduce:
	 - ProcessRequest - to be called automatically after every request load (DONE)
	 - RenderRequest - to be called when "Server" tab is clicked
	 - SetRequestHTML - to be called by renderer to make the rendered HTML visible for the request
	 
- Initialize a new Renderer object for every unique renderer URL. When the requests
  are handled call the appropriate renderer. Allow different renderers to exist
  at the same time for different request URL's.

- Allow the ProcessRequest method to render debug data in dedicated FirePHP panel.
	=> Will log to firebug console for now.

- Test suite to allow testing of Renderers outside of Firebug (in main browser)
  and thus allow debugging of renderer code using firebug.
  
- Plugin system for default renderer and processor to add custom functionality easily  
  
- Expanding of stack trace does not work after Firebug is detached.
  Need to reload page at the moment.
