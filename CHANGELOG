	- Set defaultPanelName preference to "console" if set to
	  "FirePHP" to prevent Firebug from failing silently when
	  extension is removed and "FirePHP" panel is still selected.
	  Thanks to Matthieu Honel for the suggestion.
	  A patch has been submitted to Firebug: http://groups.google.com/group/firebug/browse_frm/thread/a6233d09fb7ed779/bbb09160c2c23e4b#bbb09160c2c23e4b

	- Added a sidebar and button to toggle sidebar.
	  The sidebar currently contains one listbox that lists all
	  events fired by Firebug as they occur. This will help
	  during development to establish a clean order of events.
