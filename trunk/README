	Requirements
------------------------------------------------------

Client Side:

	- Firefox - http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/
	- Firebug - http://www.getfirebug.com/ (Version: 1.0b8)

Server Side:

	- The code is being developed under PHP5 however
	  it should work with PHP4 as well


------------------------------------------------------
	Install
------------------------------------------------------

	This project is still in Alpha stage.
	No packages for easy install have been built yet.
	
	To test out the code follow these instructions:
	
	1) Checkout code from:
		
		svn checkout http://firephp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
		
	2) Configure Firefox to load the extension:
			
			a) Place a file called "FirePHPExtension@firephp.org"
			   into the /extensions/ directory of your Firefox profile
			b) The content of the file should be the filepath
			   to the /FirefoxExtension/ directory of the code you
			   checked out above
			   e.g. P:\packages\com.googlecode.firephp\FirefoxExtension\

	3) For the server PHP code you have two options:
	
			a) Setup a new apache vhost and domain that points to
			   the /apache/ directory of the code you checked out above
			   
			   To see a test page you would then need to navigate to
			   
			   <YOUR_DOMAIN>/PINF/com.googlecode.firephp/TestPage.php
			   
			OR
			
			b) Include the FirePHP Server code in your own PHP project.
			   To get started you can simply include the following file:
			   /PearPackage/FirePHP/Init.inc.php
			   (Again this is form the code you checked out above)
			   
			   Secondly you need to configure apache to respond to some
			   utility requests by setting up an alias in the vhost config
			   of your domain as follows:
			   
			   Alias /PINF/com.googlecode.firephp/			P:/packages/com.googlecode.firephp/apache/
			   
			   (Replace the path to point to the /apache/ directory
			   of the code you checked out above)

	4) Navigate to the URL that will call your PHP code (or to the
	   test page URL mentioned above) which in trun will call the
	   server components of the FirePHP tool.

	   Open the FireBug extension and click on the "FirePHP" tab.

	   If everything is working properly you should see a page request
	   in the panel including the name of the frame it is loaded into
	   and the URL that is currently loaded.


------------------------------------------------------
	TODO
------------------------------------------------------

	- Information on how the extension works
	- Documentation for the PHP API
	- Add ability for server to store request information in a separate data store
	  that can then be accessed by the extension via the RequestID to obtain more info
	  about the request. This will remove data from the HTTP Response Headers
	  and will not require the PHP script output to be buffered
  - Add ability to request list to expand each request to view more info
	- When mousing-over the requests in the panel highlight the corresponding frame
	- Allow inspection of applications running in subdirectories of a domain where the
	  root domain knows nothing of FirePHP
	- Enable the extension to work on clustered applications with a centralized data store
	- Allow the developer to set variables in the extension that can be accessed
	  from the PHP backend to enable and disable the tracking of specific info.
	  The list of available variables should be dynamically determined for each page
	  by reflecting the server code.
	- Implemenet authentication to restrict backend data access, store developer profiles and
	  only store the backend data if in development mode.


------------------------------------------------------
	Roadmap
------------------------------------------------------

	1) Setup www.firephp.org site to give the project a home other than Google Code Hosting
		- Setup a test page that shows all available features
	2) Build easy-install versions of the Firefox extension and PEAR package
	3) Get moving on the TODO list

	This project is being developed on an as needed basis	at this point in time.
	Any help in testing, developing, writing documentation is welcome.
