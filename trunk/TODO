- Allow enable/disable of FirePHP per domain for security reasons
- Only send FirePHP accept headers when Firebug and FirePHP are enabled for the domain

- Introduce FirePHP-Parser header with URL to javascript that parses FirePHP data after every request.
  This can then insert data into Firebug console automatically and also work with the mask to set specific variables
  to watch so they are automatically inserted into Firebug console under their own PHP/Server log type.
